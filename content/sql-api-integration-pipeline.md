## The Challenge

Recently, I was looking into building a system that could:

1. Pull data from external APIs using SQL
2. Store this data efficiently
3. Set up automatic alerts based on specific conditions
4. Generate and send custom reports based on these alerts

Here's what I learned.

## The Solution: SQL + API Integration Pipeline

The solution involves several components working together:

### 1. Database Setup

You need a solid database to store your API data. Popular options include:

- PostgreSQL (great for analytics and complex data)
- MySQL (widely supported)
- SQL Server (ideal for Microsoft environments)

### 2. API Connection Code

Here's how you can connect to APIs using PostgreSQL's foreign data wrapper:

```sql
-- Setting up the connection to the API
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgres_fdw;

CREATE SERVER api_server
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw
OPTIONS (host 'api.example.com', port '443', dbname 'apidata');

-- Alternative: scheduled job approach
CREATE PROCEDURE fetch_api_data()
LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Your API call logic goes here
    -- Then insert the results into your local table
    INSERT INTO api_data
    SELECT * FROM api_response;
END; $$;
```

### 3. Alert System Configuration

Alerts are based on thresholds that you define:

```sql
CREATE TABLE alert_thresholds (
    metric_name VARCHAR(100),
    warning_threshold FLOAT,
    critical_threshold FLOAT,
    recipients VARCHAR(1000),
    last_alert_sent TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_alerts()
RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    alert_record RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR alert_record IN
        SELECT
            a.metric_name,
            a.warning_threshold,
            a.critical_threshold,
            a.recipients,
            m.current_value
        FROM alert_thresholds a
        JOIN metrics m ON a.metric_name = m.name
        WHERE
            m.current_value > a.critical_threshold AND
            (a.last_alert_sent IS NULL OR a.last_alert_sent < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours')
    LOOP
        -- Logic to send the alert
        -- Update timestamp to prevent spam
        UPDATE alert_thresholds
        SET last_alert_sent = NOW()
        WHERE metric_name = alert_record.metric_name;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### 4. Automated Report Generation

Reports can be generated automatically with stored procedures:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE generate_daily_report()
LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
DECLARE
    report_content TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Build the report content
    SELECT
        'Daily Report: ' || CURRENT_DATE || E'\n\n' ||
        'Total transactions: ' || COUNT(*) || E'\n' ||
        'Revenue: $' || SUM(amount) || E'\n' ||
        'Anomalies detected: ' || COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_anomaly = TRUE)
    INTO report_content
    FROM transactions
    WHERE transaction_date = CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day';

    -- Send the report via email
    PERFORM send_email('recipient@example.com', 'Daily Report', report_content);
END;
$$;
```

### 5. Scheduling Everything

Use a scheduler to run everything automatically:

```sql
-- Using PostgreSQL's pg_cron extension
CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron;

-- Get new API data hourly
SELECT cron.schedule('0 * * * *', 'CALL fetch_api_data()');

-- Check for alert conditions every 15 minutes
SELECT cron.schedule('*/15 * * * *', 'SELECT check_alerts()');

-- Send daily report at 7am
SELECT cron.schedule('0 7 * * *', 'CALL generate_daily_report()');
```

## Important Implementation Notes

If you're implementing this yourself, keep in mind:

- Different database systems will require slightly different syntax
- For complex reporting needs, consider adding tools like Apache Airflow or Power BI
- Store your API credentials securely
- Test thoroughly with small datasets before scaling up

## Next Steps

If you're building a system like this:

1. Start by identifying your data sources and required APIs
2. Choose your database system based on your existing tech stack
3. Set up a small proof of concept with one API and simple alerts
4. Gradually expand with more data sources and complex reporting rules

Remember that the trickiest part is usually handling API rate limits and authentication properly, so focus on making those parts robust first.

Happy coding!
