# The Connection Count Conundrum

Hey there! Ever dealt with a database that's throwing a tantrum with endless connection creep? This is a story of how we wrestled our PostgreSQL connections back into submission.

## The Initial Cry for Help

Our team was facing a gnarly problem: PostgreSQL connections were multiplying like rabbits, and our application performance was taking a serious hit. We needed a hero (or in this case, a systematic approach) to save the day.

## Understanding the Challenge

Here's the deal â€“ connection count doesn't just magically increase. There are real, fixable reasons behind this:

- Connection leaks in application code
- Transactions left hanging
- Poor connection pool configuration
- Missing connection timeout settings

## Our Battle Plan: Solving from Easiest to Most Complex

### 1. Quick Wins: Database Configuration

We started with the lowest-hanging fruit â€“ PostgreSQL configuration. A few simple commands and config tweaks could make a big difference:

```sql
-- Check current settings
SHOW max_connections;
SHOW idle_in_transaction_session_timeout;
SHOW statement_timeout;
```

Configuration changes:
```
idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '10min'
statement_timeout = '5min'
max_connections = 100
```

### 2. Connection Cleanup

Next, we wrote scripts to terminate problematic connections:

```sql
-- Terminate idle connections over an hour old
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'idle' 
AND current_timestamp - state_change > interval '1 hour';
```

### 3. Application-Level Improvements

We ensured proper connection handling in our code. Here's a Java example:

```java
try (Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection()) {
    // Database operations
} // Connection automatically closed
```

### 4. Connection Pooling with PgBouncer

For the more complex solution, we implemented PgBouncer:

```ini
[databases]
* = host=127.0.0.1 port=5432

[pgbouncer]
listen_port = 6432
pool_mode = transaction
max_client_conn = 1000
default_pool_size = 20
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Start simple: Configuration is your first weapon
2. Clean up existing mess before making big changes
3. Always close your connections
4. Consider connection pooling for complex systems

## Pro Tips

- Regularly monitor your database connection metrics
- Set up alerts for unusual connection patterns
- Don't be afraid to terminate misbehaving connections

## Final Thoughts

Database performance is part science, part art. Each system is unique, so what worked for us might need tweaking in your environment.

Remember: Persistent monitoring and incremental improvements are your best friends!

**Happy debugging! ðŸš€**
